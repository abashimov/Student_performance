The landscape of education is inherently multifaceted, influenced by a myriad of factors that extend beyond mere academic prowess. In this project, we delve into the realm of secondary education, specifically focusing on student achievement in Mathematics and Portuguese within two Portuguese schools. The dataset at hand is a rich repository of information, comprising student grades and an array of demographic, social, and school-related features meticulously collected through school reports and questionnaires.
The overarching goal of this project is to unravel the intricate tapestry that weaves together the elements impacting success in the academic domains of Mathematics and Portuguese. This exploration entails a comprehensive examination of variables beyond traditional academic metrics, considering the broader socio-demographic context in which students navigate their educational journey.
